# InStock Inventory Management System

## Project Overview
InStock is a modern, scalable inventory management system designed for a Fortune 500 client. Built with a React front-end and an Express back-end, this application solves performance and scalability issues in the client’s existing system. It was developed as part of a collaborative, agile project where the team worked together to deliver a robust full-stack web application.

This project is a part of the BrainStation Software Engineering bootcamp, where we applied industry-standard tools, technologies, and methodologies to bring the project to life. The front-end features were developed in React, utilizing react-router-dom for routing, and the application’s look and feel closely adhere to the design specifications provided in a Figma mockup.

## Features
- **Modern React UI:** The front-end is built with React, offering a dynamic and responsive user experience.
- **Routing:** Using `react-router-dom` to navigate between different views, making it easy for users to manage and view inventory data.
- **State Management:** The application utilizes React’s state management to handle dynamic data, ensuring smooth interaction with the back-end.
- **Responsive Design:** The UI closely resembles the Figma mockups across all screen sizes and breakpoints, ensuring consistency in visual design.
- **Inventory Management:** Allows users to add, update, and delete inventory items while maintaining real-time data sync with the back-end.
- **Search and Filter Functionality:** Users can search, filter, and sort inventory data to easily manage large volumes of products.

## Team Collaboration
This project was developed by an Agile team, with four members taking an equal share of front-end and back-end tasks. We worked collaboratively using Jira to track progress, manage tasks, and ensure we met deadlines. Pull requests were reviewed by teammates to ensure code quality and proper integration of features.

## What I Contributed
- **React Front-End:** Built core components, integrated with the back-end API to manage inventory data.
- **Routing:** Implemented routing using `react-router-dom` to enable smooth navigation between pages.
- **Styling:** Used SASS to implement a responsive design, adhering to the Figma mockups and ensuring a consistent user experience.
- **Collaboration:** Worked within an Agile framework, participating in sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and code reviews.
